<dt>Is OpenEd really free?  What's the catch?</dt>
<dd>Searching and browsing through OpenEd’s standards-aligned resources is, and always will be, absolutely free. OpenEd’s playlist and course features are also completely free. We built OpenEd first and foremost as a resource for teachers of K-12 students. In the coming months, OpenEd will be offering additional premium services including analytics that measure student progress and resource usage. These value-added features will be available for a subscription price of just $20 per month, and will support OpenEd’s continued growth.</dd>

<dt>What is the audience?  Who should use OpenEd?</dt>
<dd>OpenEd is designed to be used by teachers or parents to choose resources for their students.  Students can access OpenEd to view the course topics and resources assigned to them to view or use, and can also search for more resources.</dd>

<dt>Will you use my information, either my registration or my search history?  </dt>
<dd>We will never share your information or reveal anything about your individual usage or that of your students.  We do analyse usage patterns of resources across the OpenEd userbase  to make better resource recommendations and alignments. We look at what you use and like and use that information to make recommendations to other users.  But we do not share that information.</dd>

<dt>There are several other ed resource catalogs.  What's different about OpenEd?</dt>
<dd>Other educational catalogs have generally been started about a decade ago.   Their central approach was to "crowdsource the problem": hoping that teachers would post their resources and align them to standards.   The approach never took off and none of them reached critical mass: none of have more than 10,000 aligned resources and most have much less. OpenEd takes a much different approach.   We perform a "deep semantic crawl" of the Internet to import resources with knowledge of all metadata, using machine learning algorithms to align those resources to standards. We then validate those alignments in high volume with a crew of professional educator "curators".</dd>

<dt>So then who is behind OpenEd? Is it a non-profit too?</dt>
<dd>OpenEd was started by a team of experienced Silicon Valley technologists to bring a computer science approach to the hard problem of finding aligned resources for all standards.  We also are committed to a modern elegant and intuitive user experience.   </dd>

<dt>How is OpenEd funded?</dt>
<dd>OpenEd is funded by founders, friends and family.   There is sufficient operating capital for many years of operation.  OpenEd will be released as open source so its longterm availability is ensured.  </dd>

<dt>Who is on the OpenEd team? </dt>
<dd>OpenEd is a team of around a dozen software developers, computer scientists and leading Common Core-experienced K-12 educators. </dd>

<dt>What standards do you support?</dt>
<dd>OpenEd supports Common Core Math, Common Core Language Arts, Common Core Literacy for History and the Sciences, Next Generation Science Standards, California History, New York Common Core Social Studies and National Geography standards.  We have many other standards groups under development including National Science Education Standards and Council for Teachers of Mathematics</dd>

<dt>There are many other Learning Management Systems.  Why did you do your own LMS?</dt>
<dd>OpenEd was designed to support usage from leading LMSes such as Moodle, Canvas and Edmodo.   However the feedback we have gotten from teachers is that the LMS used or recommended by their school was too complicated or they just did not use it. To address this need we created our own very simple LMS.  We think it may be the simplest  LMS available.  That said, we encourage use of any LMS and welcome when teachers are using another LMS. </dd>

<dt>You seem to like KhanAcademy a lot.  Can't I just use Khan for all this?</dt>
<dd>Khan Academy is great. But it is less than 2% of all resources we have available.  We find that assigning multiple resources tailored to different learning styles is the best approach.  We have yet to see a single standard for which we recommend just assigning Khan videos and no other material.</dd>

<dt>You says its open source.  Do you mean the resources or OpenEd's source code itself?   How much of OpenEd is open source? What license?  Where is the source code?  </dt>
<dd>We will be releasing most of the source code at http://github/openedinc shortly under MIT license.  Specifically we will be releasing the catalog itself, the user interface, and the LMS.   We will not be releasing the recommendation engine or the analytics</dd>

<dt>OK, a quarter million resources is impressive.  But is that as big as it gets?   YouTube has millions of videos.  Even millions of hits on "education". Why do I need an "ed resource catalog"?</dt>
<dd>We continue to add thousands of resources a week with the OpenEd semantic crawler. We ensure that all resources are high quality and directly K-12 relevant. This is very important for K-12 teachers. If you are dubious search for a Common Core standard on youtube such as "A.APR.4"</dd>

<dt>Why "Open Ed" the octopus?  </dt>
<dd>The octopus represents "deep" or "thick" crawling with full semantic information versus a typical web crawling "spider". Octopi are smart and we think Ed's pretty cute.</dd>

<dt>Why are there more Math resources than Language Art resources?</dt>
<dd>Math standards are easier to align. The Common Core Language Art Standards are a new approach and will take more time for resources to become available. OpenEd does not develop content. We just make it simple for you to find the resources that are out there.</dd>

<dt>Does OpenEd have any capabilities for special needs students?</dt>
<dd>OpenEd can be used in a variety of ways to meet the needs of any student.  Individual course plans can be tailored for each child's needs. The student can review and rewind as much as they need in private. The student can get close to a large computer screen or wear headphones to increase the volume.  </dd>
